Itâ€™s been 2 years since you built this API. The API overtime has become slow. Which columns would you index to improve the performance of the API ? Why ?

Indexes available in following tables
***********************************
Movie table -> movie_id, show_id, theatre_id (primary key and foreign key)
Theatre table -> theatre_id (primary key)
Shows table -> show_id (primary key)

The columns that are in where clause and join should be indexed to improve the performance of the API. So when we query for shows in a specific theater on a specific date movie_date column needs to be indexed.
